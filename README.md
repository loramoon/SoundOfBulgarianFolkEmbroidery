## Introduction

In Bulgarian folk embroidery, a limited number of colours (available through natural dyeing of the threads) are used, along with repetition and symmetry of the motifs.
In music, we also have a limited number of tones that we use, repetition, and harmony.
After years of engaging in music and embroidery, I began to see musical compositions in the embroidery pattern. 
I wondered what the result would be if the colours were replaced with musical notation.

In my project, I analyse and categorise the colours used in Bulgarfolkonal embroidery. 
This analysis aims to identify and catalogue the primary colours used in traditional designs, which will then be converted into musical notes. 
By transforming visual information into music, I aim to explore a new way of interpreting and representing the rich heritage of Bulgarian folk embroidery.

### Methods

### The process involves:

1. Color Extraction: Applying image analysis code to extract the primary colours from the 144 embroidery samples.
2. Palette Analysis: Identifying common colour schemes and shades used in Bulgarian folk embroidery.
3. Conversion to Music: Translating the identified colours into musical notes to create a novel representation of the traditional embroidery patterns.
4. Applying the Colours to Notes mapping on 3 designs chosen from the internet.

## Conclusion

This project successfully explored the fascinating intersection between Bulgarian folk embroidery and music by developing a method to translate traditional colour patterns into musical compositions. Through the careful extraction and analysis of colours from embroidery samples, we identified key colour schemes and mapped them to musical notes, creating a novel representation of cultural heritage.

The results demonstrate that traditional visual art forms can be reinterpreted through music, offering a fresh perspective on cultural preservation. This work not only celebrates the rich traditions of Bulgarian embroidery but also opens up new avenues for artistic expression, where visual and auditory arts converge.

While the current method has proven effective, there are several potential areas for further exploration. Future work could involve refining the color-to-note mapping to incorporate more complex musical structures, experimenting with different cultural art forms, or even developing interactive tools that allow users to create music from their own visual designs. Additionally, collaborations with ethnomusicologists and artists could deepen the understanding and impact of this interdisciplinary approach.

In conclusion, this project serves as a stepping stone towards a deeper integration of visual and auditory arts, encouraging further research and innovation in this exciting field.

By itself, the output files may seem like a random repetition of notes, but with additional and appropriate subsequent refinement, it produces a surprisingly pleasant sound.
